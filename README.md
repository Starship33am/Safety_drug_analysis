One of the main challenges in drug discovery and development processes is to balance drug efficacy
and potential adverse effects as early as possible, thereby reducing safety-related attrition, particularly
before the later stages of clinical development. It is estimated that approximately 75% of all adverse
drug reactions are dose-dependent and can be predicted based on preclinical compound profiling.
In-vitro pharmacological profiling involves studying the binding of a compound of interest against a
broad range of proteins (targets)—such as receptors, ion channels, enzymes, and transporters—that
are distinct from the intended therapeutic target(s).
The profiling panel helps identify specific off-target interactions that may lead to undesired biological
effects as the suppress the function or action of an organ or part. This approach is primarily
employed during the lead generation and lead optimization phases of small-molecules drug discovery.
It is used to select key candidates for further development and to guide the design of in vivo studies.
In later stages of drug discovery, this data provides valuable insights into in vivo effects before
conducting first-in-human trials.

To identify compounds with similar binding responses, the following methodology was implemented
to analyze the experimental results. It starts with a data validation, cleaning, then we focused on
INHIB% parameter, we used those tests to build a standard database and finally this database was
analyzed to identify if it was possible to stablish clusters and to measure similarities and distances
across the compounds.
